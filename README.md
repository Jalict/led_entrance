# led_entrance
Arduino System for giving me light by night!

Works by checking an IR sensor near my door. 
If the door is opened, then the LED floor light will turn on. When the door is closed, then the light will stay turned on for t amount of time.

Ciruit, Components and parts will be updated later.
